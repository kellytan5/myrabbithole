        <p>I am a passionate Computer Science graduate based in Markham, Ontario, with a keen interest in software engineering, 
          artificial intelligence, and UX/UI design. I thrive on solving complex problems and creating intuitive, visually appealing 
          digital experiences.</p>
        <p>Over the years, I’ve worked on various projects and completed multiple internships, gaining hands-on experience in frontend 
          and backend development, user-centered design, and AI-driven applications. I love collaborating with teams—both in-person and 
          remotely—across the Greater Toronto Area to bring innovative ideas to life.</p>
        <p>I’m always eager to learn and explore new technologies, and I’m excited about opportunities that allow me to grow as a 
          developer and designer.</p>
